### Changes
- Add `KafkaProducer#producePassthrough` for only keeping the passthrough after producing. ([#74][#74])
- Change `KafkaConsumer#stream` to be an alias for `partitionedStream.parJoinUnbounded`. ([#78][#78])
  - This also removes `ConsumerSettings#fetchTimeout` as it is now unused.
- Change to improve type inference of `ProducerMessage`. ([#74][#74], [#76][#76])
  - To support better type inference, a custom `fs2.kafka.ProducerRecord` has been added.
  - If you were using the Java `ProducerRecord`, change to `fs2.kafka.ProducerRecord`.
- Change to replace `Sink`s with `Pipe`s, and usage of `Stream#to` with `Stream#through`. ([#73][#73])
- Remove `ProducerMessage#single`, `multiple`, and `passthrough`. ([#74][#74])
  - They have been replaced with `ProducerMessage#apply` and `ProducerMessage#one`.
  - If you were previously using `single` in isolation, then you can now use `one`.
  - For all other cases, you can now use `ProducerMessage#apply` instead.
- Rename `KafkaProducer#produceBatched` to `produce`. ([#74][#74])
- Remove the previous `KafkaProducer#produce`.
  - For previous behavior, `flatten` the result from `produce`. ([#74][#74])

### Miscellaneous
- Change to include current year in license notices. ([#72][#72])
