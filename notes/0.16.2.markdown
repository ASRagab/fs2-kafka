### Changes
- Add support for offset commit recovery. By default, only `RetriableCommitFailedException` are retried with a jittered exponential backoff for 10 attempts, switching to fixed rate retries for up to 5 attempts (see `CommitRecovery#Default` for more details). If you want to keep the previous behaviour (no retries), use the following on `ConsumerSettings`. ([#9][#9])

```scala
consumerSettings
  .withCommitRecovery(CommitRecovery.None)
```

- Fix `KafkaConsumer#fiber` instance to work as expected. Most notably, `join` and `cancel` should work as expected, with `join` no longer possibly becoming non-terminating after calling `cancel`. This also means that streams should be interrupted as expected. See `KafkaConsumer#fiber` for more details. ([#11][#11])

### Miscellaneous
- Change to run `doc` instead of `packageDoc` in `validate`. ([#10][#10])
